# Clustering_Methods
Task1 : Analysing benchmark clustering datasets with the help of K-means and Hierarchical clustering. To assess the quality of the clusters created, internal and external validation were also done. Further visualized the clusters in 3d for improved classification.

Task2 : Performed a clustering study on a dataset of global indicators. K-means and hierarchical clustering techniques were used to group similar countries together. Reported the cluster quality and the optimum clustering solution using internal validation metrics.
