# Clustering_Methods
Optimizing clustering algorithms such as K-means and Hierarchical clustering using maths intuition. The models will be trained on benchmark datasets in order to check the accuracy of the model in general sense. External validation is used for performance evaluation and at last clusters will be visualized in 3d.
